The Magic School Bus is a web application compatible on Macs and iPads. While I was working on this assignment, I was interested in bringing back my childhood memories of watching the Magic School Bus. I remember my classmates and I would chant along with the theme song and wonder over where our next field trip would be.

## Requirements
  * Greensock GSAP3 (Shockingly)
  * Mapbox GL JS and token
  * Flask 1.1.2
  * Python 3.8.8
  * NodeJS v18.8.1

## Project Setup
Clone the repo
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/debbieyuen/magical.git
```

Make sure you have NPM. If not installed, install the latest version of NPM.
```bash
$ npm install -g npm
```

Check to make sure it was installed successfully.
```bash
$ npm -v
$ node -v
```

Set up GSAP by adding the following to your .npmrc file either for your profile ($ vim ~/.npmrc) or at the root of your project.
```bash
$ //npm.greensock.com/:_authToken=b7bce164-5019-4e5d-98b5-70eba6754ec4@gsap:registry=https://npm.greensock.com
```

The first time you install GSAP to a project, install via.
```bash
$ npm install gsap@npm:@gsap/shockingly
```

You may also install all free and bonus plugins by downloading the zip file and installing via the following command.
```bash
$ npm install ./gsap-bonsu.tgz
```

Or install GSAP without bonus plugins. 
```bash
$ npm install gsap
```

Install Flask
```bash
$ pip install Flask
```

In Visual Studio Code, install the Live Server Extension to quickly run the website locally on your machine. Else, run the program in your terminal.
Clone the repo
```bash
$ open index.html
```
## Bonus Question

I attempted the bonus question using Flask. Feel free to see my code in the 'bonus' folder.

Run app.py
```bash
$ flask run
```
